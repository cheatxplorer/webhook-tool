Hey, welcome to ![discohook](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/736648398081622016.webp)**Discohook**! The easiest way to personalize your Discord server.

There's more info below if you want to read it. When you're ready, press **Clear All** at the top of the editor to delete what's written here.

What is this?

At its core, Discohook is a simple message designer. You can use it to send fully customizable messages to your Discord server with the use of [webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668).

Discohook Utils - complementary bot

You can [invite our bot here](https://discohook.app/bot). In case you recognize that name, Discohook [merged with Discohook Utils](https://discohook.app/guide/deprecated/migrate-utils) in 2024. If you have Discobot in your server, invite Discohook Utils instead for all future use.

Get started

- To send your first webhook message, click **Add Webhook** at the top left of the editor.
- You'll be prompted to put in the URL of a webhook you have already created, or make a new one on the spot with **Create Webhook**.

  - If you create a new webhook with this button, you'll be able to add buttons to your message as well.
- Finish up by clicking **Add Webhook** inside the prompt.

  - You should now see your webhook name & avatar at the top of the editor. If you would like to edit this webhook, click the pencil icon. To change the name/avatar for just one message, use the **Profile** section of the editor.
- Now click **Send**. Choose which messages you would like to send with your webhook (they are all enabled by default).
